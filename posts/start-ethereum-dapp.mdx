You will find a simple frontend implementation for a ERC-20 token with some functions derived from it as an example. Also you can find an end-to-end test for the [Open Zeppelin ERC-20 implementation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20).

> By using this tool you don't need to worry about configurations but only implement your business.

## How to use the repo?

Many of the problems has been solved, the idea behind `start-ethereum-dapp` is help you to accelerate your development flow, by providing all you always need. **When you deploy them by using any of the different ways describes below a new `contracts` folder will automatically generate inside the `frontend` folder. There you will find:**

- the contracts address deployed for

  `.frontend/contracts/{_contractName_}-address.json`,

- the contracts ABI and

  `.frontend/contracts/{_contractName_}.json`,

- the contracts types.

  `.frontend/contracts/types/{_contractName_}.ts`

## Stack

### At the backend

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) to compile [Solidity](https://solidity-es.readthedocs.io/es/latest/index.html) and deploy your [Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) to test.

### At the frontend

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) enhanced with [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) at the top of it. [Web3Modal](https://web3modal.com/) and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) for the 3 at Web and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) for the beauty with [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) and [React-Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) already installed to increase the chill out.

## 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/start-ethereum-dapp/start-ethereum-dapp.git --recursive
```

## 2. Setting up the project.

1. If you want to send your contracts to a non-local network you need a provider. [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) is already set up for Goerli and Mainnet, but you can change it in `hardhat.config.js`. When you have your API KEY copy and paste it in the `example.env` file and delete the `example` word from.

2. You also need an **Etherscan API KEY** in order to verify your contracts. Go [here](https://etherscan.io/) and get you key. When you do that paste it in the `.env` file.

3. To deploy the contracts you also need to provide your **[Wallet private key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key)**, **and you can set up the public key in the `.env` file to fund your account with test ETH**.

That's all.

## 3. Running the project.

### Let's start with the backend part

```bash
# ./backend

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run a local test network
npm run chain

# Deploy to local test network
npm run deploy-local

# Deploy to Goerli test network
npm run deploy-goerli

# Deploy to Ethereum Mainnet
npm run deploy-mainnet

# Deploy to Polygon test network (Matic)
npm run deploy-polygon # ! No tested

# Run the test
npm test
```

### Let's go with the frontend

```bash
# ./frontend

# Install the dependencies
yarn install
```
