## A. What is `start-eth-dapp`?

ðŸ™‚

## B. Setting up locally

There are two ways to set up your local instance of `start-eth-dapp`.

### a. Download the .zip file.

- You can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JaSi-0qjEvqYTCc4i_hv-CZwPVZ_vWNl/view?usp=sharing).

- Once you got it, extract it continue with the **step 4** down below.

### b. Clone the repositories from GitHub.

1. Make a folder to contain the project.

For example:

```bash
mkdir awesome-project
```

Then:

```bash
cd awesome-project
```

2. Inside your project folder, clone the **backend** repo.

```bash:project-directory/
git clone https://github.com/start-eth-dapp/backend.git
```

3. Inside your project folder, clone the **frontend** repo.

```bash:project-directory/
git clone https://github.com/start-eth-dapp/frontend.git
```

4. By now you must have two folders, **backend** and **frontend** inside of your root folder. So you need to install the dependencies for each one.

- Inside your **backend** folder:

```bash:project-directory/backend/
npm i
```

- Inside your **frontend** folder:

```bash:project-directory/frontend
yarn install
```

At this point you have all you need to start building, so let's see whats inside this folders and understand how works each part.

## C. Setting up project requirements

## Backend

There are some requirements we need to check out before start using `start-eth-dapp`.

```ts:backend/hardhat.config.ts
// This is no all the code inside that file.

const ALCHEMY_TESTNET_API_KEY = process.env.ALCHEMY_TESTNET_API_KEY;
const ALCHEMY_MAINNET_API_KEY = process.env.ALCHEMY_MAINNET_API_KEY;
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || "";
const ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY;

...

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {

  ...

    matic: {
      url: "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com",
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    goerli: {
      url: `https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_TESTNET_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    mainnet: {
      url: `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_MAINNET_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: ETHERSCAN_API_KEY,
  },
};

...

```

`start-eth-dapp` come with deploy ready for Local testnet, Polygon Mainnet, Goerli testnet and Ethereum mainnet. In addition it have a etherscan
connection to allow you to verify your contracts. Let's look up how to get the requirement keys in order to get all of this running up.

- **PRIVATE_KEY**. If you are thinking to deploy your contracts in other network than local testnet you need to provide your **wallet private key** to sign the
  transactions. [Here you find how to do that in Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
  **Remember to keep your key secure and far away of malicious eyes ðŸ‘€**. Once you got it, copy and paste inside the `.env` file.

- **ALCHEMY_TESTNET_API_KEY**. If you want to deploy on Goerli testnet you need a way to connect with the network. Alchemy achieve that by you and provide
  and easy way to get that goal. First you need to create an [Alchemy account](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) and then, go to the dashboard, create a new project
  and get the _key_.

- **ALCHEMY_MAINNET_API_KEY**. To deploy on mainnet is the same way I explain before, the only different is that you donÂ´t select **Goerli** on the **Create App**
  menu but select **Mainnet**.

    priority
  />

- In addition to this, you need to add your public wallet address to get some test ETH to allow you to use the local network. In
  `.env` file set your public key in PUBLIC_KEY variable.

  You finally should have an `.env` looking like this:

  <Image
    alt={`.env example`}
    src={`/images/env.png`}
    width={800}
    height={250}
    priority
  />

- **ETHERSCAN_API_KEY**. The same here. Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), create and account, go to your profile section and look up for the **API Keys**
  option on the left side menu, add a new API key and thats all.

## D. Understanding the files.

Now we are ready to write our code. But, where?

Inside you backend folder you will find a `contracts` folder where your Solidity code live. When you download `start-eth-dapp` you will get two examples contracts
and a test for one of those. Those contracts and test does not have any special meaning, there pretend to be a example for you to figure out how to do your own.

---

> **NOTE:
> You must call your main contract as Main.sol and the name of the contract also must be Main to the moving script can find it.**

---

## E. Interacting with the contracts.

Once you have done your contracts you have some ways to interact with.

### a. Deploying locally.

To deploy your contracts to a local network you must first run a local blockchain by using the terminal.

Open your terminal and _cd_ into your backend directory and run

```bash:backend/
npm run chain
```

In a few seconds you can see your local blockchain running up on http://127.0.0.1:8545/ by default.

To deploy your contracts to your local blockchain open a new terminal window and run

```bash:backend/
npm run deploy-local
```

This command will compile and deploy and give you some information about the deploy through the terminal.

> **You donÂ´t need to copy your contracts address, it will be store in a newly created `frontend/contracts`
> directory with the ABI too. By this way you get what you need to work with your contracts in your frontend
> at ease. Go there and look.**

---

To run the test simply run

```bash:backend/
npm test
```

and you get some feedback too.

### b. Deploying remote.

We will looking how to do it with Goerli, but it works exactly the same on Mainnet.

To deploy your contracts to a Goerli you just need to run

```bash:backend/
npm run deploy-goerli
```

and you will get the same logs than locally.

> Your contracts address and ABI will be stored in the same way that locally deploy do. Remember `frontend/contracts`.

And that's all for the backend part. Let's look up the front.

## Frontend

In your **frontend** directory you will find a `contracts` directory. And two files inside of it.

- `Main-contract-address.json` that contains the address where you contract was deployed and
- `Main.json` that contains the contract ABI.

In `frontend/components/tasks` you can find a not fully implementation of the Main.sol contract that live in the backend.
You can look up and figure out how to implement your own contracts. In addition, in `frontend/components/Header.tsx` you can
find a fully implementation of a Metamask connection, so, one problem less.

That's how easy it is to have a decentralized application to start building your next idea. So good luck.

## F. Knowing issues.

1. If you stop and rerun the local network Metamask throw to you the following error:

```json:error
MetaMask - RPC Error: [ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC
{
  "value": {
    "code": -32603,
    "data": {
      "code": -32000,
      "message": "Nonce too high. Expected nonce to be 0 but got 1. Note that transactions can't be queued when automining.",
      "data": {
        "message": "Nonce too high. Expected nonce to be 0 but got 1. Note that transactions can't be queued when automining."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
